## Overview

The NVIDIA AI-Q Blueprint is an enterprise-grade research agent built on the [NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/). It gives you both **quick, cited answers** and **in-depth, report-style research** in one system, with benchmarks and evaluation harnesses so you can measure quality and improve over time.

</p>

**Key features:**

- **Orchestration node** — One node classifies intent (meta vs. research), produces meta responses (for example, greetings, capabilities), and sets research depth (shallow vs. deep).
- **Shallow research** — Bounded, faster researcher with tool-calling and source citation.
- **Deep research** — Long-running multi-step planning and research to generate a long-form citation-backed report.
- **Workflow configuration** — YAML configs define agents, tools, LLMs, and routing behavior so you can tune workflows without code changes.
- **Modular workflows** — All agents (orchestration node, shallow researcher, deep researcher, clarifier) are composable; each can run standalone or as part of the full pipeline.
- **Evaluation harnesses** — Built-in benchmarks (for example, FreshQA, DeepResearch) and evaluation scripts to measure quality and iterate on prompts and agent architecture.
- **Frontend options** — Run through CLI, web UI, or async jobs; the [Getting started](#getting-started) and [Ways to run the agents](#ways-to-run-the-agents).
- **Deployment options** - Deployment assets for a [docker compose](deploy/compose/) as well as helm deployment.

## Architecture

AI-Q uses a LangGraph-based state machine with the following key components:

- **Orchestration node**: Classifies intent (meta vs. research), produces meta responses when needed, and sets depth (shallow vs. deep) in one step
- **Shallow research agent**: Bounded tool-augmented research optimized for speed
- **Deep research agent**: Multi-phase research with planning, iteration, and citation management

Each agent can be run individually or as part of the orchestrated workflow. For detailed architecture documentation, refer to [Architecture](docs/source/architecture/overview.md).

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/aiq.git && cd aiq
```

### Automated Setup

Run the setup script to initialize the environment:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This script:
- Creates a Python virtual environment with uv
- Installs all Python dependencies (core, frontends, benchmarks, data sources)
- Installs UI dependencies (if Node.js is available)

### Manual Installation

For selective installation, install packages individually:

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.13 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install core with development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install frontends (pick what you need)
uv pip install -e ./frontends/cli          # CLI frontend
uv pip install -e ./frontends/debug        # Debug console
uv pip install -e ./frontends/aiq_api      # Unified API (includes debug)

# Install benchmarks (pick what you need)
uv pip install -e ./frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench
uv pip install -e ./frontends/benchmarks/freshqa

# Install data sources (pick what you need)
uv pip install -e ./sources/tavily_web_search
uv pip install -e ./sources/google_scholar_paper_search
uv pip install -e "./sources/knowledge_layer[llamaindex,foundational_rag]"
```

### Obtain API Keys


| API        | Environment Variable | Purpose                   | Required                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| NVIDIA API | `NVIDIA_API_KEY`     | LLM inference through NIM | Yes                                                         |
| Tavily     | `TAVILY_API_KEY`     | Web search                | No (if not specified, agent continues without web search)   |
| Serper     | `SERPER_API_KEY`     | Academic paper search     | No (if not specified, agent continues without paper search) |


#### Obtain an NVIDIA API Key

1. Sign in to [NVIDIA Build](https://build.nvidia.com/)
2. Click on any model, then select "Deploy" > "Get API Key" > "Generate Key"

#### Obtain a Tavily API Key

1. Sign in to [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Generate an API key

#### Obtain a Serper API Key

1. Sign in to [Serper](https://serper.dev/)
2. Generate an API key from your dashboard

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `deploy/` directory:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
```

Replace your API keys.

> **Note:** If you do not want to use paper search, follow the steps in the [Customization guide](docs/source/customization/tools-and-sources.md#disabling-a-tool) to disable it.

## Ways to Run the Agents

The `frontends/` directory contains different interfaces for interacting with the agents. You can also run agents directly through the NeMo Agent Toolkit CLI.

### Command-line interface (CLI)

The CLI provides an interactive research assistant in your terminal:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run with the convenience script
./scripts/start_cli.sh

# Verbose logging
./scripts/start_cli.sh --verbose

# Or run directly with the NeMo Agent Toolkit CLI
nat run --config_file configs/config_cli_default.yml
```

The CLI frontend source is in `frontends/cli/`.

### Web UI

For a full web-based experience:

```bash
./scripts/start_e2e.sh
```

This starts:
- Backend API server at `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend UI at `http://localhost:3000`

The web UI source is in `frontends/ui/`. Refer to [frontends/ui/README.md](frontends/ui/README.md) for more details.

#### Web UI with Docker Compose

You can also run the backend and UI with Docker Compose:

```bash
cd deploy/compose

# No-auth local setup (LlamaIndex default)
docker compose --env-file ../.env -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --build

# To select a different backend config, set BACKEND_CONFIG in deploy/.env, for example:
# BACKEND_CONFIG=/app/configs/config_web_frag.yml
```

For more details, refer to:
- `deploy/compose/README.md`

### Async Deep Research Jobs

Endpoints, SSE streaming, and debug console: refer to [frontends/aiq_api/README.md](frontends/aiq_api/README.md).

### Benchmarks

To run agents in evaluation mode, refer to the [Evaluating the Workflow](#evaluating-the-workflow) section.


## Evaluating the Workflow

The `frontends/benchmarks/` directory contains evaluation pipelines for assessing agent performance.

### Available Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Description | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Deep Research Bench | RACE and FACT evaluation for research quality | `frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/` |
| FreshQA | Factuality evaluation on time-sensitive questions | `frontends/benchmarks/freshqa/` |

### Running Evaluations

First, install the benchmark package:

```bash
uv pip install -e ./frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench
```

Then run the evaluation with one of the available configurations:

```bash
dotenv -f deploy/.env run nat eval --config_file frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/configs/config_deep_research_bench.yml
```

For detailed benchmark documentation, refer to:
- [Deep Research Bench README](frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/README.md)
