## Overview

NVIDIA AI-Q provides a multi-agent deep research system that produces comprehensive, cited research reports. It uses an orchestrator that delegates to a planner (evidence-grounded planning via web search) and multiple researcher subagents (ensemble web search + academic paper search), then synthesizes findings into a final report. It is built using [NVIDIA NAT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit) and the [deepagents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11-3.13
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- NVIDIA API key from [NVIDIA Build](https://build.nvidia.com/)

Recommended for research quality:
- Tavily API key (web search)
- You.com API key (web search)
- Serper API key (paper search)

## Setup

Clone and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/aiq.git && cd aiq
git checkout drb1
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Create your environment file:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
```

## API Keys

Set the keys in `deploy/.env`:

| API | Environment Variable | Purpose | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NVIDIA Build | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | Agent LLM inference | Required |
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Judge LLMs for evaluation configs | Required |
| Tavily | `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Web search backend | Required |
| You.com | `YOU_API_KEY` | You.com deep search backend | Optional |
| Serper | `SERPER_API_KEY` | Academic paper search | Required |
| Jina | `JINA_API_KEY` | FACT evaluator page retrieval | Optional |

### You.com API Key

1. Create/sign in to your You.com developer account.
2. Generate an API key.
3. Add `YOU_API_KEY=<your_key>` to `deploy/.env`.

#### Obtain an NVIDIA API Key

1. Sign in to [NVIDIA Build](https://build.nvidia.com/)
2. Click on any model, then select "Deploy" > "Get API Key" > "Generate Key"

#### Obtain a Tavily API Key

1. Sign in to [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Generate an API key

#### Obtain a Serper API Key

1. Sign in to [Serper](https://serper.dev/)
2. Generate an API key from your dashboard

## Running Evaluation

### Step 1: Install the dataset

The dataset files are not included in the repository. We have included a script to retrieve them from the [Deep Research Bench Github Repository](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench/tree/main) and format them for the NeMo Agent Toolkit evaluator.

To download the dataset files, run the following script:

```bash
python frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/scripts/download_drb_dataset.py
```

### Step 2: Generate reports using NAT evaluation harness

```bash
dotenv -f deploy/.env run nat eval --config_file frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/configs/config_ensemble.yml
```

### Step 3: Convert the output into a compatible format
```bash
python frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/scripts/export_drb_jsonl.py --input <path to your workflow_output.json> --output <path to the output file you want to create with .jsonl extension>
```

### Step 4: Post Process Reports using an LLM (Claude Opus)
```bash
python frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/scripts/rewrite_prompt.py --input <path to agent generated outputs from step 3> -c 5
```

### Step 5: Run evaluation
Follow instructions in the [Deep Research Bench Github Repository](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench/tree/main) to run evaluation and obtain scores.

## Optional: Phoenix Tracing

If your config enables Phoenix tracing, start the Phoenix server before running `nat eval`.

Start server (separate terminal):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
phoenix serve
```

Default UI endpoint: `http://localhost:6006`
